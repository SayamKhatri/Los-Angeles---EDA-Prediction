# Los-Angeles---EDA-Prediction
The objectives center on uncovering meaningful insights and patterns within this dataset, which can inform decision-making, influence policy formulation, and enhance proactive law enforcement strategies. 

In this project, " Cleaning and Analyzing Crime Data" I undertake an in-depth investigation of
a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2020 to the present, focusing on real-world crime
occurrences. The objectives center on uncovering meaningful insights and patterns within this
dataset, which can inform decision-making, influence policy formulation, and enhance proactive
law enforcement strategies. Analysis commences with the careful acquisition and thorough
inspection of the dataset, addressing data types, missing values, duplicates, and data quality
issues. By the end of the data cleaning phase, I have a refined dataset that serves as the
foundation for our exploratory data analysis. 
# In the heart of my analysis lies the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, where I explore a multitude of aspects related to crime data:

Overall Crime Trends: I examine the long-term trends in crime rates over the years, offering a
view of how crime has evolved from 2020 to the present.

Seasonal Patterns: The analysis uncovers potential seasonal variations in crime data, with
insights into which months exhibit the most significant fluctuations.

Most Common Crime Type: Identifying the most frequent type of crime is crucial for law
enforcement, guiding their strategic planning and resource allocation.

Regional Differences: I segment the data by region or city to illuminate variations in crime
rates, allowing for more effective localized approaches to crime prevention.

Correlation with Economic Factors: The efforts extend to incorporating economic data for the
same period, engaging in statistical analysis to identify potential correlations between socioeconomic factors and crime rates.

Day-of-the-Week Analysis: By grouping data by the day of the week, I gain insight into
variations in crime frequencies, which can guide the allocation of resources and interventions.

Impact of Major Events: I explore how specific dates affect crime rates, examining changes
occurring 30 days before and after each event to understand their implications.The major events that took place during 2020-2023 are Zero Bail Policy, Covid Lockdown,
Lockdown Reopen. These events had a major impact on the crime rates of Los Angeles. 



# Interesting Trends, Correlations, or Anomalies in The Data:

• Anomaly in 2020: The sharp drop-in crime rates in 2020 due to the pandemic was a
noteworthy anomaly, showcasing the significant impact of external events on crime trends.

• Seasonal Impact: The consistent rise in crime rates during summer months aligns with
previous research but raises questions about the influence of seasonality on criminal
behavior.

• Gender Disparities: The observed gender-based disparities in crime victimization warrant
further investigation into potential underlying factors.

• Economic Correlations: The identified correlations between economic factors and crime
rates underline the complex relationship between socio-economic conditions and criminal
activities.

• Weekend Effect: The consistent increase in crime rates during weekends suggests a recurring
trend that law enforcement agencies may consider when allocating resources and planning
interventions.

• Policy-Driven Changes: The analysis uncovered correlations between major policy changes
and fluctuations in crime rates, emphasizing the role of social and policy dynamics in
criminal behavior. In summary, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of
crime data, unearthing insightful patterns and correlations. These findings have implications
for law enforcement, policymakers, and researchers in shaping proactive strategies for crime
prevention and public safety. The anomalies and recurring trends identified in the data
underscore the multifaceted nature of crime patterns and the need for evidence-based
decision-making.
